Certainly! Let's break down the explanation of the provided Solidity code and create a README.

### Project Title

Advanced Smart Contract

### Simple Overview of Use/Purpose

This smart contract demonstrates the use of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements in different scenarios. It includes features for depositing and withdrawing funds, as well as executing a complex operation that enforces specific conditions.

### Description

The Advanced Smart Contract is a Solidity smart contract designed to showcase the usage of three important statements in Ethereum development: `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()`. The contract includes an ownership mechanism, allowing certain functions to be executed only by the contract owner. Key functionalities include:

1. **Deposit**: Users can deposit Ether into the contract using the `deposit` function.

2. **Withdraw**: The contract owner can withdraw funds, demonstrating the use of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements to handle conditions such as insufficient funds or invalid withdrawal amounts.

3. **Complex Operation**: The `complexOperation` function demonstrates how these statements can be used in more complex scenarios, enforcing conditions on function parameters.
